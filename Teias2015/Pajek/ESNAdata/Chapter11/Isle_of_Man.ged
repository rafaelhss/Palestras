1 NOTE [From notes of interview with Grace Louise Allen.]
1 NOTE John W. Allen had a cousin John (This would probably be John E. Allen, son of
2 CONT John K. Allen).  Grace's brother Bob remembers going to his house, which had
2 CONT high, dark
1 NOTE panelled living room.  He had a wooden toy train and Bob wanted to
1 NOTE play with it but they would not let him.  John E.'s father ran a
1 NOTE tailor shop.  Cousin John coached John W. for membership in the
1 NOTE Masons.
1 NOTE There were other Manx people who lived in Atchison.  Grace remembers
1 NOTE going to a pot luch dinner with Manx families.
1 NOTE The J. W. Allen family left Atchison, when Grace was in 1st grade, to
1 NOTE farm.  J. W. worked in Atchison during the week at Blish, Mize, &
1 NOTE Sullivan Hardware and then farmed on the weekend.  He was a foreman at
1 NOTE the hardware company.
1 NOTE They moved back into Atchison later, into a big white house on a bluff
1 NOTE over the Missouri River in the northeast section of Atchison.  J. W.
1 NOTE Allen remodeled it and sold it when Grace was in the third grade.
1 NOTE Apparently, he did well buying and selling real estate.  With the
1 NOTE proceeds from the sale, he bought a bigger farm, painted the outside,
1 NOTE lived there for about a month, and then sold it.  (Grace walked to
1 NOTE school in the snow and sometimes some older kids would pick them up
1 NOTE and let them ride on their horse.)
1 NOTE JWA bought another farm of about 160 acres at Effingham, Kansas.
1 NOTE There Grace had a pony, which she rode to school.  After a while, JWA
1 NOTE sold the 160 acres and moved his family to Potter, 18 miles southeast
1 NOTE of Effingham, opened a hardware-general store, and went broke.  (It
1 NOTE seems he had a soft heart and gave credit to anyone that wanted it and
1 NOTE was not able to collect much of it.)  After this he moved to Easton,
1 NOTE Kansas, 5 miles south of Potter, opened another store, which he
1 NOTE remodeled, and the family lived upstairs over the store.
1 NOTE After this the family moved to Baldwin City, Kansas, a college town
1 NOTE (now Baker University is there).  There he had a grocery store and a
1 NOTE fresh meat market.
1 NOTE [From taped conversation with Grace Allen Green]
1 NOTE At the home in Easton, they lived above the store.  They didn't live in any of
2 CONT these towns very long.  She doesn't know what was wrong with her Dad.
1 NOTE House in Potter.  It was a nice house.  When it got cleaned, Grace cleaned it. 
2 CONT Her mother was no house keeper.
1 NOTE One July her Dad bought all kinds of fireworks.  Then everything was
2 CONT permissible.  This was for the kids to sell.  They put up a stand out in the
2 CONT front yard and sold them.  All that they didn't sell, they got to fire.  They
2 CONT didn't work to hard to sell them.
1 NOTE Store in Potter.  Had a little bit of everything.  A general store. When he got
2 CONT ready to move he would bring someone in to put on a sale and clear the store
2 CONT out.  Sell everything whether he made any money or not.  Just get rid of a it,
2 CONT so they could buy a new stock of something else.
1 NOTE When leaving Baldwin, what was left over, he piled onto the Chalmer car and
2 CONT headed for Washington.  Longview Washington.  It was in the spring and they
2 CONT took the southern route.  Didn't get any farther than California.  When they
2 CONT got to San Bernadino, school was opening and they wanted the kids to be in
2 CONT school, so they just stopped and put the kids into school.  Jack went downtown
2 CONT to get a job and went to work for Safeway selling vegetables.  He take anything
2 CONT until he got on his feet and then he wanted to open a store.

1 NOTE was in the States he spent Xmas with some of the family.  Some lived
1 NOTE in Cleveland, & some in Atcheson, Kansas, I think.  One or two were
1 NOTE dentists, but I think all of descendants of the two or more orignial
1 NOTE Allens who went out did quite well.  We had at one time a large family
1 NOTE group of them.  One of them, called Carrie Allen, came to England to
1 NOTE marry a Mr. Quiggan, a solicitor who lived near Blundellsands.  She
1 NOTE was very nice and I wished we had seen more of her when she was in
1 NOTE England.  After her husband's death she returned to the States, but
1 NOTE wrote reularly to Father of who she was very fond.
1 NOTE "There was a Mr. Allen who came over fromthe Statees with an important
1 NOTE mission during the last ware, & ass I believe he came from a district
1 NOTE in which some of the cousin Allens were settled, I sometimes wondered
1 NOTE if he might be a distant relative."

1 NOTE Newspaper notice:
1 NOTE Mrs. Ann Cooley, relic of the late James Cooley, died at her home in
1 NOTE this place at 2:20 p.m., Sunday, March 17, 1912 after a lingering
1 NOTE illness.  Up until a year ago, when she was dangerously ill, she
1 NOTE enjoyed the best of health and was quite active for one of her age.
1 NOTE Since that time - although able to be up and around - she has been
1 NOTE slowly declining.  Last Thursday she was taken suddenly worse and
1 NOTE succumbed at time above stated.  She was aged 87 years, 7 months, and
1 NOTE 9 days.
1 NOTE Ann Henderson was born in Brockville, Province of Ontario, Canada,
1 NOTE August 8, 1824.  When about twenty years of age she moved with her
1 NOTE parents to the United States and settled at Hebron, Wisconsin.  Here
1 NOTE she was married to James C. Cooley March 7, 1849.  Three children were
1 NOTE born to this union, all of whom survive and were at her bedside when
1 NOTE the end came.  They are Clarence and James C., of this place, and Mrs.
1 NOTE Clara Burgess, of Atchison, Kans.  Six grandchildren and four great
1 NOTE grandchildren also survive.
1 NOTE In October, 1859, the Cooleys moved to Kansas and settled on a form
1 NOTE south west of Hartford.  In 1891 they moved to Hartford, shortly after
1 NOTE which, Mr. Cooley died - October 19, 1891.  Since his death, Mrs.
1 NOTE Cooley and her youngest son, James C., have lived in this place.
1 NOTE Another name is stricken from the ever lessening roll of our old
1 NOTE settlers, and a lonely home and her children are left to attest how
1 NOTE sadly they will miss her.  Yet in such a death there is no cause for
1 NOTE grief.  Her life work was done, and well done.  She had passed her
1 NOTE attended time and wearied with life's duties, wearied of  suffering
1 NOTE and waiting, she lay down to rest.
1 NOTE She was a woman of enerous impulses and never forgot the hospitable
1 NOTE ways of the pioneer.  She bore adversity bravely, not only when they
1 NOTE first landed on Kansas soil, but while her husband was in the civiel
1 NOTE war, fighting for the perpetuity of our Union.  The deceased had an
1 NOTE excellent memory and when time bore heavily upon her she would spend
1 NOTE many pleasant hours recounting to her friends the struggles, as well
1 NOTE as the pleasure, through which she and her husband had passed.
1 NOTE Mrs. Cooley united with the Methodist Church when a young woman, but
1 NOTE on account of advanced age had taken no part in church work for some
1 NOTE years.
1 NOTE Funeral services were held from the M. E. church Tuesday afternoon,
1 NOTE conducted by the pastor, Rev. E. T. Rice, assisted by Rev. C. R. Rice.
1 NOTE Internment was made in the Harford cemetery.  The pallbearers were
1 NOTE Messrs. Wm. Sickles, W. H. Flickinger,  Jacob Hagel, John E. Edwards,
1 NOTE W. H. Baysinger and A. N. Gillum.

2 CONT still stands (1997) in Kk Michael parish churchyard (Isle of Man Family History
2 CONT Society's
1 NOTE plan Row H, number 8) .
1 NOTE Parish Register (Microfilm PR24 Manx National Heritage) of Kk Michael Burials -
2 CONT John Caine (Filloin) of ye Bishop's Demesne Jan 7 1724.
1 NOTE His burial is listed also in Ballaugh register - Jon Cain (Filliown) of the
2 CONT Lord Bishop's Demesne buried at Kirk Michael. The Ballaugh entry has an
2 CONT incorrect date of  Dec 7 1724. (The duplication of register entries is said to
2 CONT stem from rivalry
1 NOTE between the vicars of Michael and Ballaugh as to which parish church those
2 CONT living on the boundary at Bishop's Court land should attend).
1 NOTE The meaning of Filloin (or Fillown) is not known. It  was thought at first to
2 CONT be a placename but this now seems less likely. It might  have been a nickname
2 CONT or an indication of occupation. Family History Society burials records for
2 CONT Michael give
1 NOTE FILLREN instead of FILLOIN and this appears to be a transcription error.
1 NOTE My own theory is that FILLOIN could mean SON OF JOHN.  A computer search on FIL
2 CONT in the burial records of the parishes of Michael, Ballaugh and Bride turned up
2 CONT 21 examples of the use of  the Latin FILIUS, a son, or FILIA, a daughter, and
1 NOTE derivations such as FILL, FIL, and FILS. The word OIN is Manx Gaelic for JOHN.
2 CONT The word FILN was also found and this could be an abbreviation of FILLOIN.
1 NOTE His Will is on Microfilm RB 527 at Mx Nat Heritage and is headed BALLAUGH 1724.
2 CONT This might imply that he was of that parish. Although his Will mentions his
2 CONT wife there is no indication of her Christian or maiden names.
1 NOTE The IGI provides no records of marriage for a John Caine during the relevant
2 CONT period and it must be noted that the earliest marriage records for Ballaugh
2 CONT date from May
1 NOTE 1695 and for Michael from June 1656.
1 NOTE We have so very little to go on concerning our ancestor John Caine who died in
2 CONT January 1724. We do not know his parents, his date of birth, the name of his
2 CONT wife, or his age at death. It is, in fact, sheer luck that his gravestone still
2 CONT survives
1 NOTE in Michael churchyard.
1 NOTE SPECULATION - It is unlikely that any earlier information will be found.
2 CONT However, if John was, say, 74 at death he would have been born in 1650. The IGI

1 NOTE The 1841 Census lists a William Caine, a 27 year old shoemaker, living at

2 CONT tailor. It thus appears  that he is the elder son of William and Esther.
1 NOTE His age of 27 in 1841 would indicate a birth date of 1814.
1 NOTE A copy of an Indenture of the apprenticeship of a William Caine son of William
2 CONT Caine of Kirk Michael is at Manx National Heritage, ref: MD 172-8, and is dated
2 CONT 21 Oct 1830. William was apprenticed "..to Thomas Nelson parishioner and

2 CONT would have been 21 in 1830, the indenture date, which would be old for an

1 NOTE Reputed to have been born at Kessingland, Suffolk. A reply of 6 May 1975 ref.
2 CONT 029010 to an enquiry to the UK General Register Office stated they were unable
2 CONT to locate an entry of her birth over the period 1861-1865 but suggested that,
1 NOTE nevertheless, a baptismal record might exist. A search of the IGI has failed to
2 CONT find a baptismal entry in Suffolk but that of her brother Charles Wilby has
2 CONT been located on 7th July 1867 at St Peter's church, Liverpool.
1 NOTE It is possible that, like her brother, she was born at whatever port Captain
2 CONT Rackham was sailing from. It has also been said by Mrs Margaret Gelling that
2 CONT she believes that Mary Jordan Rackham, her grandmother, was born at sea.
1 NOTE Philip Wilby Caine, her eldest son, wrote in a letter of about 1942 to his
2 CONT nephew, John Wilby Caine, that -
1 NOTE "James Caine (your grandfather) married Mary Jordan Rackham, daughter of Wilby
2 CONT Rackham, born at Kessingland, near Lowestoft, and Mary Crosbie, who was born in
2 CONT England but whose family came from Dumfries".
1 NOTE This statement might, at first sight, appear ambiguous but, read carefully, it
2 CONT seems to say that it was Capt. Rackham who was born at Kessingland and, as he
2 CONT was baptised at Wrentham, some four miles away, this might have been true. If
2 CONT this was
1 NOTE the meaning that Philip W. Caine intended to convey, then although Mary Jordan
2 CONT Rackham might well have been born at Kessingland, he does not say so. (Capt
2 CONT Rackham did in fact state in official seafaring documents that he was born at
2 CONT Wrentham).
1 NOTE Mary Jordan Rackham came to Douglas with her widowed mother and brother Charles
2 CONT Wilby  in 1880 and also with William and Sarah Crosbie, her grandparents. She
2 CONT is listed in the 1881 Census at 17 Victoria Road, Douglas as grand daughter of
2 CONT William
1 NOTE Crosbie. Aged 18. Born in England.
1 NOTE She is reputed to have met her future husband James at the Well Road Methodist
2 CONT Chapel which was on the site of the present Social Security headquarters at
2 CONT Markwell House.
1 NOTE She died 21 May 1939 and is buried at Marown churchyard.

1 OCCU Sea Captain
1 NOTE The IGI lists a baptism of WELBY (sic) RACKHAM to JOHN and ELIZABETH RACKHAM on
2 CONT 26th February 1831 at Wrentham Independent Congregational Church. Wrentham is
2 CONT about 4 miles south west of Kessingland in Suffolk.
1 NOTE Also listed in the IGI is the baptism of another child named WILBY RACKHAM at
2 CONT Wrentham on 30 July 1837 to the same parents, JOHN and ELIZABETH RACKHAM.
1 NOTE In the absence of an age at death for Capt. Wilby Rackman, it seemed that
2 CONT either child could have been him. However, it was thought  unlikely that two
2 CONT sons would have been given the same name during the lifetime of the first born
2 CONT and the 1831
1 NOTE child might have died in infancy.  In 1997, Maritime Research of Hythe,
2 CONT Southampton were commissioned to investigate Captain Wilby Rackham and they
2 CONT proved this assumption was incorrect and that he had been born in 1831.
1 NOTE They produced the following 8 documents -
1 NOTE Wilby Rackham declared on a  form entitled "Application to be Examined" for a
2 CONT Master's Ordinary Certificate of Competency in the Foreign trade, and which he
2 CONT signed on 3rd February 1859, that he was born at WRENTHAM in the county of
2 CONT SUFFOLK on
1 NOTE 21st January 1831. He gave his address as GISLEHAM, Near Lowestoft, Suffolk.
2 CONT (Gisleham is a tiny village approximately midway between Lowestoft and
2 CONT Kessingland). The application was addressed to the Local Marine Board for the
2 CONT Port of Glasgow
1 NOTE and he requested that his Certificate be sent to the Shipping Office or Custom
2 CONT House at Glasgow. At the foot of the form is a note dated 4th February 1859
2 CONT that he had "Passed as Ordinary Master".
1 NOTE He spelled his name as WILBY and his signature was also in that form. The
2 CONT spelling of WELBY used in the February 1831 baptismal entry is an error.
2 CONT However unusual it might have been for another child in the same family to have
2 CONT been given the
1 NOTE same name this appears to be the case.
1 NOTE Another document is headed "List of Testimonials and Statement of Service, from
2 CONT Time of First Going to Sea". He was apprenticed on 5th February 1847, shortly
2 CONT after his 16th birthday, at North Shields and the vessel's name is given as
2 CONT Elliotts
1 NOTE although this was probably the ship owner's name. He sailed with Elliotts as an
2 CONT Able Seaman in March 1851 but it is noted that on 14th March he was "Discharged
2 CONT on Loss of Ship" after a voyage of 6 days.
1 NOTE His Statement of Service included 12 vessels (excluding his service with
2 CONT Elliotts) and on 14 November 1856 he first sailed as Mate. In 1858 whilst on
2 CONT the "Harriet Julia", registered at Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, the Master
2 CONT died at sea and
1 NOTE on 17th December Wilby Rackham, although not obtaining a Master's Certificate
2 CONT until the following February,  became Master. By January 1859, by which time
2 CONT the Statement of Service had no more space, his total service at sea was 9
2 CONT years and 3
1 NOTE months. Unfortunately no further Statements of Service have come to light.
1 NOTE The other 6 documents which were discovered by Marine Research are concerned
2 CONT with Certificates of Competency. They are -
1 NOTE A certificate issued at Shields No(rth) on 8th October 1856 that the Bearer, of
2 CONT Dock Lane, Bull Ring, North Shields, Northumberland, had passed an Ordinary
2 CONT Examination at Newcastle on 1st October 1856. This is signed by Wilby Rackham
2 CONT and gives
1 NOTE his date of birth as 1831 at Wrentham, Suffolk..
1 NOTE A Certificate of Competency as Second Mate, given under the Seal of the Board
2 CONT of Trade on 6th October 1856 and entered at the General Register and Record
2 CONT Office of Seamen on 7th October.
1 NOTE A certificate issued at Shields No(rth) on 18th October 1856 that the Bearer,
2 CONT of Dock Lane, Bull Ring, North Shields, had passed an Ordinary Examination at
2 CONT Shields on 10th October 1856. This is signed by Wilby Rackham and gives his
2 CONT date of
1 NOTE birth as 1831 at Wrentham, Suffolk.
1 NOTE A Certificate of Competency as Only Mate, given under the Seal of the Board of
2 CONT Trade on 16th October 1856 and entered at the General Register and Record
2 CONT Office of Seamen on 17th October.
1 NOTE A certificate issued at Glasgow on 10th February 1859 that the Bearer, of
2 CONT Gisleham, near Lowestoft, had passed an Ordinary Examination at Glasgow on 3rd
2 CONT February 1859. This is signed by Wilby Rackham and gives his date of birth as
2 CONT 1831 at
1 NOTE Wrentham, Suffolk.
1 NOTE A Certificate of Competency as Master, given under the Seal of the Board of
2 CONT Trade on 8th February 1859 and entered at the General Register and Record
2 CONT Office of Seamen on 9th February.
1 NOTE Capt. Wilby Rackham was lost at sea, according to Philip Wilby Caine, in 1868. 
2 CONT One family tradition, which the compiler of these notes had been brought up on,
2 CONT was that his vessel had  foundered on the Goodwin Sands. Martin Faragher wrote
2 CONT in
1 NOTE 1984 that Capt. Rackham "had been lost with his ship in sight of his native
2 CONT East Anglia". However, it does seem that there may be some doubt about the
2 CONT locality of the loss.
1 NOTE "Manx Life", in August 1993, published "Memories of Childhood" by the late Miss
2 CONT Alice Caine who recalled that her grandmother, Mary Billington Rackham, who
2 CONT died in 1920, would tell her "stories about 'The Captain', my grandfather, and
2 CONT how she
1 NOTE sailed with him to the West Indies and about the pet monkey on the ship and the
2 CONT pig who was known as Dennis...".
1 NOTE Mrs Margaret Anne Gelling, nee Caine, understood that he was lost at sea on a
2 CONT voyage to America. She had also been given to believe that his daughter, Mary
2 CONT Jordan Rackham, had been born at sea. This might account for the lack of
2 CONT success in
1 NOTE tracing a baptism or registration of birth for her.
1 NOTE The name "WILBY" was given to Capt. Wilby Rackham's son, Charles Wilby Rackham,
2 CONT to his grandson, Philip Wilby Caine, and to his great grand son John Wilby
2 CONT Caine.
1 NOTE The name Wilby is used within our family as a given name but it is really a
2 CONT surname and one which is commonly found in Suffolk. There is a small community
2 CONT called Wilby near the town of Eye in Suffolk.
1 NOTE Wilby Rackham's daughter Mary Jordan Rackham, wife of James Caine, is reputed
2 CONT to have been born at Kessingland near Lowestoft, Suffolk. An inquiry to the UK
2 CONT General Register Office in 1975 failed to find an entry of birth over the
2 CONT period 1861 -
1 NOTE 1865.  A search of the IGI for Suffolk has also failed to find her baptism.
2 CONT However, the baptism of her brother Charles Wilby Rackham has been located in
2 CONT the IGI on 7th July 1867 at St Peter's church, Liverpool. It may be that Mary
2 CONT Jordan
1 NOTE Rackham was born or baptised away from Kessingland. She was not listed in
2 CONT Lancashire IGI. The suggestion that she was born at sea might be the correct
2 CONT solution.

1 NOTE John's Will appointed his un-named wife as one of his executors (Microfilm RB

1 NOTE In his Will he ordered that "..his wife should have the cow towards paying the
2 CONT debts and bequests..".  He left "..to his eldest son Thomas his part of the
2 CONT roofs of the houses..". Many houses in country districts consisted of turf and
2 CONT sod walls.
1 NOTE Timber was extremely scarce and supplies were augmented by ancient  trees
2 CONT preserved in bogs and timber washed up on beaches. Often  the only items of
2 CONT value in a house  were the roof timbers, which supported a thatch or turf roof,

2 CONT were at LAUFAS on EYJAFJORDUR, a fjord in the north of Iceland. The "turf" used

1 NOTE This clue was followed up but no baptismal record has been found in 1709 but
2 CONT there was a baptism on 9th December 1710 at Kk  Michael, of a Margt. Caine,
